Here is the final fix your developer needs to implement.

The Missing Step: Registering Routes with a Blueprint

The standard Flask pattern for organizing routes in separate files is to use a Blueprint. Your developer needs to create a Blueprint in app.py and then "register" that Blueprint with the application inside the create_app factory in main.py.

Step 1: Create a Blueprint in app.py

Your developer needs to modify app.py to create a Blueprint and attach all the route functions to it using @main_routes.route() instead of @app.route().

File to Edit: app.py

Python
# app.py

import os
import logging
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, jsonify, send_file, session
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
# ... other necessary imports from app.py

# 1. Create a Blueprint object
main_routes = Blueprint('main_routes', __name__)

# 2. Attach all your route functions to the Blueprint
#    Replace every "@app.route(...)" with "@main_routes.route(...)"

@main_routes.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@main_routes.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    # ... function logic remains the same
    # NOTE: Any reference to 'app.config' must be replaced.
    # Use 'from flask import current_app' and then 'current_app.config'
    # Example:
    # from flask import current_app
    # output_path = os.path.join(current_app.config['OUTPUT_FOLDER'], f"{task_id}_optimized.glb")
    # ...
    return jsonify({'message': 'success'}) # Placeholder

# ... apply this decorator change to ALL route functions in this file ...

@main_routes.route('/progress/<task_id>')
def get_progress(task_id):
    # ... function logic ...
    return jsonify({'status': 'ok'}) # Placeholder

# And so on for /download, /cleanup, /admin/stats, etc.
Step 2: Register the Blueprint in main.py

Now, tell the main application about this Blueprint inside the create_app factory.

File to Edit: main.py

Python
# main.py

# ... (other imports)
from app import main_routes # <-- Import the Blueprint you just created

# ...

# --- THE APPLICATION FACTORY ---
def create_app():
    """
    Creates and configures the Flask application object.
    """
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # ... (all your existing config loading) ...

    # 3. Register the Blueprint with the app
    app.register_blueprint(main_routes)

    logger.info("Flask application created and routes registered.")
    return app

# ... (rest of the file)
Why This Works

Decoupling: The routes are no longer dependent on a global app object. They are organized into a self-contained Blueprint.

Centralized Registration: The create_app factory becomes the single place where all parts of your application (configs, routes, middleware) are brought together.

Gunicorn Compatibility: This pattern works perfectly with Gunicorn. Each worker will call create_app() to get a fully configured application instance with all the routes properly registered.

Once the developer makes these changes, the application will be fully refactored, the "404 Not Found" errors will be gone, and it will be ready for production deployment with Gunicorn.
