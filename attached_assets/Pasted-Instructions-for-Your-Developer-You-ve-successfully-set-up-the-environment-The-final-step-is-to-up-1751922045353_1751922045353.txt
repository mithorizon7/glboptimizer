Instructions for Your Developer

You've successfully set up the environment. The final step is to update the optimizer to use the correct commands for the newly available KTX-Software.

The Goal: Fix the texture optimization step so it stops producing blank files and starts using the high-quality KTX2/Basis Universal compression.

File to Edit: optimizer.py

Action:
In the _run_gltf_transform_textures function, you need to replace the temporary "safe" texture resizing with the correct commands for etc1s and uastc compression. The logic should be:

Attempt to use the powerful uastc command for high-quality textures.

If that fails, fall back to the etc1s command for more aggressive compression.

If both fail, use the webp command as a final safety net.

Your investigation already revealed the correct commands. Now, you just need to implement them in the script.

Example Code for _run_gltf_transform_textures:

Python
# In optimizer.py

def _run_gltf_transform_textures(self, input_path, output_path):
    """
    Step 4: Advanced texture compression with KTX2/BasisU and WebP fallback.
    This version uses the correct etc1s and uastc commands.
    """
    # ... (setup code for temp files and settings remains the same)

    # Method 1: KTX2/Basis Universal compression (Primary)
    try:
        self.logger.info("Attempting KTX2/Basis Universal compression (uastc/etc1s)...")
        
        # Define the correct command based on quality settings
        if self.quality_level == 'high':
            # UASTC is best for high quality
            ktx2_cmd = ['npx', 'gltf-transform', 'uastc', input_path, ktx2_output, '--level', '4', '--rdo', '4.0', '--zstd', '18']
        else:
            # ETC1S is better for higher compression
            ktx2_cmd = ['npx', 'gltf-transform', 'etc1s', input_path, ktx2_output, '--quality', settings['ktx2_quality']]

        result = subprocess.run(ktx2_cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=600)

        if result.returncode == 0 and os.path.exists(ktx2_output):
            results['ktx2'] = {'success': True}
            file_sizes['ktx2'] = os.path.getsize(ktx2_output)
            self.logger.info(f"KTX2 compression successful: {file_sizes['ktx2']} bytes")
        else:
            results['ktx2'] = {'success': False, 'error': result.stderr}
            self.logger.warning(f"KTX2 compression failed. Stderr: {result.stderr}")

    except Exception as e:
        results['ktx2'] = {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}

    # ... (the rest of the function with the WebP fallback and file selection logic remains the same)
By making this final change, the optimizer.py script will now correctly use the installed KTX-Software, fixing the blank file issue and enabling the full, high-quality optimization you've been working towards.
