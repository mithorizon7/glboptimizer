It went all the way through and I was able to download a file with these stats!

The problem is, when I open the file I don't see anything, both in the preview window as well as on my desktop when I open the downloaded file. There's nothing visible. It's blank, basically. Here are some ideas, if they're helpful great, if not, find what works best: 

The Problem: A "Silent" Error in the Final Step

The file is blank because the final tool in the optimization pipeline, gltfpack, is creating a valid but empty GLB file. It's like a machine that's supposed to pack a box, but it closes and seals the box before anything is put inside.

The reason this happens is that the code is passing commands to gltfpack that it doesn't understand. Specifically, these flags are meant for a different tool (gltf-transform) that was used in an earlier step:

--texture-compress

--ktx2

--no-copy

Because gltfpack doesn't recognize these commands, it gets confused, creates an empty file, and then exits successfully without reporting an error.

The Solution for Your Developer

This is a straightforward fix. Your developer needs to edit the optimizer.py file and correct the final command.

File to Edit: optimizer.py

Function to Fix: _run_gltfpack_final()

Action: Replace the existing cmd list inside that function with the corrected one below. This version removes the invalid flags and adds the correct flag for compression (-cc).

Python
# Inside the _run_gltfpack_final function in optimizer.py

# CORRECTED COMMAND:
cmd = [
    'gltfpack',
    '-i', input_path,
    '-o', output_path,
    '-cc'  # This is the correct flag for high-quality compression
]

# This is a fallback command if the first one fails
cmd_fallback = [
    'gltfpack',
    '-i', input_path,
    '-o', output_path,
    '-c' # Basic compression
]
By making this change, the gltfpack tool will receive the correct instructions, properly bundle the optimized model, and the final .glb file will contain your visible, highly-compressed 3D model.
