What's Still Broken:

The Core Modular Pipeline: The root cause of the AttributeError: ... has no attribute 'optimizer' still exists in pipeline_tasks.py. The new fallback logic is a smart workaround, but the modern, multi-step pipeline remains unusable.

The Cleanup Scheduler: The cleanup_scheduler.py file still has the original Celery import bug and will fail to run, meaning old files will not be automatically deleted.

Development Startup: The develop.py script is still missing default environment variables, which can make local development setup fragile.

Verdict: The application has moved from "critically broken" to "partially functional." It can now process files via its legacy fallback system, but the modern, more powerful pipeline is inactive.

Next Steps to Make It Fully Operational

Here are the next systematic fixes to get the entire application working as intended.

1. Repair the Modular Pipeline (pipeline_tasks.py)

This is the most important fix to unlock the application's full potential. You need to correct the way the GLBOptimizer is used within each Celery task. The file pipeline_improvements.py already contains the correct design pattern for this.

Action: Open pipeline_tasks.py. For each task (e.g., prune_model_task, weld_model_task, etc.), ensure it creates a PipelineStage object and uses that object's optimizer instance to run the command.

Example for prune_model_task:

Python
// In pipeline_tasks.py

@celery_app.task(bind=True, name='pipeline.prune_model')
def prune_model_task(self, task_id: str, input_path: str, output_path: str, model_info: Dict[str, Any]):
    """
    Stage 2: Prune unused data and clean up model
    """
    # This stage object correctly contains its own optimizer instance.
    stage = PipelineStage(task_id, "Data Cleanup")
    stage.update_progress(15, "Removing unused data")

    try:
        prune_output = input_path.replace('.glb', '_pruned.glb')

        # This call now correctly uses the optimizer from the stage object.
        result = stage.optimizer._run_gltf_transform_prune(input_path, prune_output)

        if result['success']:
            stage.update_progress(25, "Cleanup complete")
            # Chain to the next task
            weld_model_task.delay(task_id, prune_output, output_path, model_info)
            return {'success': True}
        else:
            raise Exception(result.get('error', 'Pruning failed'))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Pruning failed: {e}")
        stage.update_progress(15, f"Cleanup failed: {str(e)}", status='failed')
        return {'success': False, 'error': str(e)}

You will need to apply this same pattern to all seven tasks within pipeline_tasks.py.

2. Fix the Cleanup Scheduler (cleanup_scheduler.py)

This is a quick fix to ensure your server doesn't fill up with old files.

Action: Open cleanup_scheduler.py. Replace the direct import of celery with the factory pattern to create a local instance.

Python
// In cleanup_scheduler.py

from celery_app import make_celery

# Create a local Celery instance using the factory
celery = make_celery()

@celery.task(name='cleanup.cleanup_old_files')
def cleanup_old_files():
  # ... function remains the same
3. Harden the Development Script (develop.py)

This change will make your local development environment more stable and less prone to configuration errors on startup.

Action: Open develop.py. At the very top of the file, add os.environ.setdefault() calls to provide sane defaults for essential environment variables.

Python
// At the top of develop.py

import os

# Set sane defaults BEFORE any other application imports
os.environ.setdefault('FLASK_ENV', 'development')
os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite:///dev.db') # Use a simple file-based database for local dev
os.environ.setdefault('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')
os.environ.setdefault('SESSION_SECRET', 'a-temporary-but-valid-secret-for-local-dev')

# The rest of the script follows...
import sys
import subprocess
# ...
By completing these three steps, you will have a fully functional, resilient, and production-ready application that works as designed. You're very close.
