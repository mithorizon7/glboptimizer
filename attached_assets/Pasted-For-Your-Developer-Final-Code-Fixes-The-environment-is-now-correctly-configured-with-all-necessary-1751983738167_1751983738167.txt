For Your Developer: Final Code Fixes

The environment is now correctly configured with all necessary dependencies. Your final task is to remove the temporary workarounds from optimizer.py to restore the full, high-quality optimization pipeline.

The Goal: Fix the texture and final bundling steps to use the most advanced compression methods available, now that the tools are installed.

Step 1: Re-enable Full Texture Optimization

The _run_gltf_transform_textures function was modified to skip KTX2. You need to remove that temporary fix and re-enable the logic that uses the uastc and etc1s commands.

File to Edit: optimizer.py

Action: In the _run_gltf_transform_textures function, find and delete the following lines:

Python
# Temporarily disable KTX2 due to performance issues - use WebP for reliability
ktx_available = False
self.logger.info("KTX2 disabled for performance - using WebP compression")
Then, ensure the ktx2_cmd logic correctly uses the uastc and etc1s commands.

Step 2: Re-enable and Fix the Final Bundling Step

The _run_gltfpack_final function was disabled to prevent file corruption. You need to re-enable it and fix the command it uses.

File to Edit: optimizer.py

Action: Replace the entire _run_gltfpack_final function with the corrected version below. This version removes the logic that skips the step and uses the correct -cc flag for high-quality compression.

Corrected _run_gltfpack_final function:

Python
def _run_gltfpack_final(self, input_path, output_path):
    """Step 6: Final bundle and minify with correct gltfpack flags"""
    try:
        # High-quality compression command using the correct flag
        cmd = [
            'gltfpack',
            '-i', input_path,
            '-o', output_path,
            '-cc'  # -cc is for higher quality compression
        ]
        result = self._run_subprocess(cmd, "Final Bundle (High Quality)", "Final bundling and minification")

        if result['success']:
            return {'success': True}
        else:
            self.logger.warning(f"High-quality gltfpack failed, falling back. Error: {result.get('error')}")
            # Fallback to basic compression
            cmd_fallback = ['gltfpack', '-i', input_path, '-o', output_path, '-c']
            return self._run_subprocess(cmd_fallback, "Final Bundle (Basic)", "Final bundling with basic compression")

    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Final optimization step failed entirely: {e}")
        # If all else fails, copy the last good file
        shutil.copy2(input_path, output_path)
        return {'success': True, 'warning': 'Final bundling step was skipped.'}
Once these changes are made, the application will finally be working as intended.
