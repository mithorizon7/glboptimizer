The deployment is failing due to a few specific configuration issues with the Replit environment. The error logs you've provided are very clear. Here is exactly what is happening and what you need to do to fix it.

The Core Problems

Based on the logs, there are two main problems preventing your application from deploying successfully:

Missing Dependencies: The most critical error is executable file not found in $PATH. This means that when Replit's server tries to run the command gunicorn ..., it can't find the gunicorn program. This happens because the packages listed in your pyproject.toml file were not installed during the deployment process.

Incorrect Server Binding: The log error proxying request error=dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5000: connect: connection refused indicates that even if Gunicorn were running, it would be listening on the wrong network interface. Your application is trying to bind to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), but Replit's hosting requires it to bind to 0.0.0.0 to be accessible from the internet.

How to Fix It

Here are the step-by-step instructions to resolve these deployment issues.

Step 1: Fix the Dependency Installation

The simplest way to ensure Replit installs all your Python packages is to create a requirements.txt file.

Action: In your project's main directory, create a new file named requirements.txt.

Content: Copy all the dependencies from your pyproject.toml file into this new file.

Your requirements.txt file should look like this:

Plaintext
celery>=5.5.3
email-validator>=2.2.0
flask>=3.1.1
flask-sqlalchemy>=3.1.1
gunicorn>=23.0.0
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
pytest>=8.4.1
pytest-flask>=1.3.0
pytest-mock>=3.14.1
pytest-playwright>=0.7.0
python-dotenv>=1.1.1
redis>=6.2.0
setuptools>=80.9.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.41
werkzeug>=3.1.3
When you run the deployment again, Replit will automatically detect this file and use pip to install all the listed packages, which will make gunicorn available.

Step 2: Ensure Correct Server Binding

You need to make sure your Gunicorn command explicitly binds to 0.0.0.0. While your .replit file already has the correct command, your gunicorn.conf.py file might be overriding it.

Action: Open gunicorn.conf.py and modify the bind variable to ensure it uses the 0.0.0.0 host.

Change this line in gunicorn.conf.py:

Python
# Old line
bind = f"0.0.0.0:{os.environ.get('PORT', '5000')}"
To this more robust version:

Python
# New, corrected line
host = os.environ.get('HOST', '0.0.0.0')
port = os.environ.get('PORT', '5000')
bind = f"{host}:{port}"
This ensures that your application listens on the correct host that the Replit deployment system expects.

After making these two changes, your application should deploy successfully.
